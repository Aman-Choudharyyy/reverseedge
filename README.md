ReverseEdge is a cybersecurity blog dedicated to the principle that sharp defense is born from understanding the offense. This repository contains the source code for the blog, which documents my journey into building proactive, intelligent, and adaptive security solutions.

> "Where cyber threats meet sharp defense."

## 🛡️ Core Focus Areas

This blog explores a range of cybersecurity topics with a hands-on approach:

*   **Reverse Engineering & Malware Analysis**: Deconstructing how malicious tools work to learn how they can be neutralized.
*   **EDR & Detection Engineering**: Designing and implementing real-time detection systems to hunt for threats as they happen.
*   **Red Team Labs**: Crafting offensive tools (like RATs) for learning, training, and simulating attacks in controlled environments.
*   **Security Automation & Dashboards**: Building visual dashboards and automated scripts to bring clarity and insight to security data.

## 🧠 The "ReverseEdge" Philosophy

The name **ReverseEdge** represents a dual-edged mindset: understanding offensive tactics to strengthen defensive strategies. The content aims to help others learn how to think like an attacker to build more resilient and effective defenses.

## ✍️ About the Author
