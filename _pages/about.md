# About Me

Hey, I'm Aman Choudhary — a cybersecurity enthusiast and student passionate about building real-time, threat-detecting systems that don't just defend — they counter.

I created **ReverseEdge** to showcase my journey into cybersecurity, from understanding how threats work to building tools that detect and respond to them efficiently. I believe security shouldn't be passive — it should be proactive, intelligent, and adaptive.

## 🔍 What I Do

- 🐀 **Reverse Engineering & Malware Analysis**  
  Breaking down how malicious tools work and how they can be stopped.

- ⚙️ **EDR & Detection Engineering**  
  Designing real-time detection systems to hunt down threats as they happen.

- 📡 **Red Team Labs**  
  Crafting offensive tools (like RATs) for learning, training, and simulating attacks in controlled environments.

- 📊 **Security Automation & Dashboards**  
  Building visual dashboards to bring clarity and insight to security data.

## 📌 Why ReverseEdge?

The name *ReverseEdge* represents a dual-edged mindset: understanding the offense to strengthen the defense. My aim is to create tools and write content that help others learn how to think like an attacker to build stronger defenses.
